# Maze-Escape

A Procedurally Generated Maze survival game.

# How-to-Play

Player must traverse through a randomly generated maze with enemies that can drain your health. Once the health bar reaches zero, its Game Over. Reach the end to win.
W,A,S,D to move the character and Mouse for look Input.

# Information

Enemy model's use Mixamo characters and Animations.
Maze Generation uses the Depth-First Search Algorithim to ensure a solvable maze.
Enemies use NavMesh to pathfind back to their patrol routes when player focus is lost.

I tried to follow multiple design patterns and SOLID priciples.
