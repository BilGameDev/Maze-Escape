# Information

Enemy model's use Mixamo characters and Animations.
Maze Generation uses the Depth-First Search Algorithim to ensure a solvable maze.
Enemies use NavMesh to pathfind back to their patrol routes when player focus is lost.

I tried to follow multiple design patterns and SOLID priciples.
